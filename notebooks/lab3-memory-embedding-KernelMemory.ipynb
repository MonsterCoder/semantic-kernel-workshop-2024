This safety equipment is essential in protecting workers from recognized hazards that are likely to cause serious physical harm or death.

The need for personal protective equipment (PPE), such as steel toe boots, depends on the results of a \"hazard assessment\" of the workplace, as per OSHA regulations. In an office setting, it's unlikely that the hazard assessment would identify risks that necessitate the use of steel toe boots. Therefore, unless your office environment presents a recognized hazard that could cause serious physical harm or death to the feet, steel toe boots would not generally be deemed necessary. The General Duty Clause, Section 5(a)(1), of the OSH Act, requires the workplace to be free from recognized serious hazards; however, office settings typically do not have the types of hazards found in industrial or construction sites.\n",

       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT3IntroductionHazards exist in every workplace in many different forms: sharp edges, falling objects, flying sparks, chemicals, noise and a myriad of other potentially dangerous situations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that employers protect their employees from workplace hazards that can cause injury.Controlling a hazard at its source is the best way to protect employees. Depending on the hazard or workplace conditions, OSHA recommends the use of engineering or work practice controls to manage or eliminate hazards to the greatest extent possible. For example, building a barrier between the hazard and employees is an engineering control; changing the way in which employees perform their work, (e.g., through job rotations) is an administrative control.When engineering, work practice, and administrative controls are not feasible or do not provide sufficient protection, employers must provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to their employees and ensure its use. Personal protective equipment, commonly referred to as “PPE”, is equipment worn to minimize exposure to a variety of hazards. Examples of PPE include such items as gloves, foot and eye protection, protective hearing devices (earplugs, muffs) hard hats, respirators and full body suits.This guide will help both employers and employees do the following: ■Understand the types of PPE. ■Know the basics of conducting a “hazard assessment” of the workplace. ■Select appropriate PPE for a variety of circumstances. ■Understand what kind of training is needed in the proper use and care of PPE.The information in this guide is general in nature and does not address all workplace hazards or PPE requirements. The information, methods and procedures in this guide are based \r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION4on the OSHA requirements for PPE as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 29 CFR 1910.132 (General requirements); 29 CFR 1910.133 (Eye and face protection); 29 CFR 1910.135 (Head protection); 29 CFR 1910.136 (Foot protection); 29 CFR 1910.137 (Electrical protective equipment); 29 CFR 1910.138 (Hand protection); 29 CFR 1910.140 (Personal Fall Protection) and regulations that cover the construction industry, at 29 CFR 1926.95 (Criteria for personal protective equipment); 29 CFR 1926.96 (Occupational foot protection); 29 CFR 1926.97 (Electrical protective equipment); 29 CFR 1926.100 (Head protection); 29 CFR 1926.101 (Hearing protection); and 29 CFR 1926.102 (Eye and face protection); and for the maritime industry at 29 CFR 1915.152 (General requirements); 29 CFR 1915.153 (Eye and face protection); 29 CFR 1915.155 (Head protection); 29 CFR 1915.156 (Foot protection); and 29 CFR 1915.157 (Hand and body protection). Please note this guide does not address PPE requirements related to respirators or respiratory protection (29 CFR 1910.134).The Requirement for PPETo ensure the greatest possible protection for employees in the workplace, the cooperative efforts of both employers and employees will help in establishing and maintaining a safe and healthful work environment.In general, employers are responsible for: ■Performing a “hazard assessment” of the workplace to identify and control physical and health hazards. ■Identifying and providing appropriate and adequate PPE for employees. ■Training employees in the use and care of the PPE. ■Maintaining PPE, including replacing worn or damaged PPE. ■Periodically reviewing, updating and evaluating the effectiveness of the PPE program.\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT5In general, employees should: ■Properly wear PPE, ■Attend training sessions on PPE, ■Care for, clean and maintain PPE, and ■Inform a supervisor of the need to repair or replace PPE. Specific requirements for PPE are presented in many differentOSHA standards, published in 29 CFR. Some standards require that employers provide PPE at no cost to the employee while others simply state that the employer must provide PPE. Appendix A at page 40 lists those standards that require the employer to provide PPE and those that require the employer to provide PPE at no cost to the employee.A final rule on payment for PPE, published in November 2007, requires that all PPE, with a few exceptions, will be provided by the employer at no cost to the employee. The 2007 final rule also clarified OSHA’s requirements regarding payment for employee-provided PPE and for replacement PPE. The final rule is found at 72 Fed. Reg. 64341-64430 (Nov. 15, 2007).The Hazard AssessmentA first critical step in protecting employees is to use a “hazard assessment to identify physical and health hazards in the workplace. Potential hazards may be physical or health-related and a comprehensive hazard assessment should identify hazards in both categories. Examples of physical hazards include moving objects, fluctuating temperatures, high intensity lighting, rolling or pinching objects, electrical connections, and sharp edges. Examples of health hazards include overexposure to harmful dusts, chemicals or radiation.The hazard assessment should begin with a walkthrough survey of the facility to develop a list of potential hazards in the following basic hazard categories:\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION6 ■Fall hazards, ■Impact, ■Penetration, ■Compression (roll-over), ■Chemical, ■Heat/cold, ■Harmful dust, ■Light (optical) radiation, and ■Biologic.In addition to noting the basic layout of the facility and reviewing any history of occupational illnesses or injuries, things to look for during the walkthrough survey include: ■Sources of electricity. ■Sources of motion such as machines or processes where movement may exist that could result in an impact between personnel and equipment. ■Sources of high temperatures that could result in burns, eye injuries or fire. ■Types of chemicals used in the workplace. ■Sources of harmful dusts. ■Sources of light radiation, such as welding, brazing, cutting, furnaces, heat treating, high intensity lights, etc. ■The potential for falling or dropping objects. ■Sharp objects that could poke, cut, stab or puncture. ■Biologic hazards such as blood or other potentially infectious material. ■Unprotected edges where fall hazards may exist.When the walkthrough is complete, the employer should organize and analyze the data so that it may be efficiently used in determining the proper types of PPE required at the worksite.\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT7The employer should become aware of the different types of PPE available and the levels of protection offered. It is definitely a good idea to select PPE that will provide a level of protection greater than the minimum required to protect employees from hazards.Then periodically reassess the workplace for any changes in conditions, equipment or operating procedures that could create occupational hazards. This periodic reassessment should also include a review of injury and illness records to spot any trends or areas of concern and taking appropriate corrective action. The suitability of existing PPE, including an evaluation of its condition and age, should be included in the reassessment.Documentation of the hazard assessment is required through a written certification that includes the following information: ■Identification of the workplace evaluated; ■Name of the person conducting the assessment; ■Date of the assessment; and ■Identification of the document certifying completion of the hazard assessment.Selecting PPEAll PPE clothing and equipment must be of safe design and construction, and be maintained in a clean and reliable fashion. Employers shall take the fit and comfort of PPE into consideration when selecting appropriate items for their workplace.PPE that fits well and is comfortable to wear will encourage employee use. Most protective devices are available in multiple sizes and care should be taken to select the proper size for each employee. If several different types of PPE are worn together, make sure they are compatible. If PPE does not fit properly, it can make the difference between being safely covered or dangerously exposed. It may not provide the level of protection desired and may discourage employee use.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION8OSHA requires that many categories of PPE meet or be equivalent to standards approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). ANSI has been preparing safety standards since the 1920s, when the first safety standard was approved to protect the heads and eyes of industrial workers. Employers who need to provide PPE in the categories listed below must make certain that any new equipment procured meets the cited ANSI standard. Existing PPE stocks must meet the ANSI standard in effect at the time of its manufacture or provide protection equivalent to PPE manufactured to the ANSI criteria. Employers should inform employees who provide their own PPE of the employer’s selection decisions and ensure that any employee-owned PPE used in the workplace conforms to the employer’s criteria, based on the hazard assessment, OSHA requirements and ANSI standards. OSHA requires PPE to meet the following ANSI standards: ■Eye and Face Protection: ANSI Z87.1-2010, ANSI Z87.1-2003, or ANSI Z87.1-1989(R1998). ■Head Protection: ANSI Z89.1-2009, ANSI Z89.1-2003, or ANSI Z89.1-1997. ■Foot Protection: ASTMF-2412-2005 and ASTMF-2413-2005, ANSI Z41-1999, or ANSI Z41-1991. ■Electrical Rubber Insulating Equipment: ASTM D120-09, ASTM D-178-01 (2010), ASTM D-1048-12, ASTM D-1049-98 (2010), ASTM D-1050-05 (2011), or ASTM D1051-08.For hand protection, there is no ANSI standard for gloves but OSHA recommends that selection be based upon the tasks to be performed and the performance and construction characteristics of the glove material. For protection against chemicals, glove selection must be based on the chemicals encountered, the chemical resistance and the physical properties of the glove material.\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT9Training Employees in the Proper Use of PPEEmployers are required to train each employee who must use PPE. Employees must be trained to know at least the following: ■When PPE is necessary. ■What PPE is necessary. ■How to properly put on, take off, adjust and wear the PPE. ■The limitations of the PPE. ■Proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal of PPE. Employers shall make sure that each employee demonstrates an understanding of the PPE training (i.e., in a language they understand) as well as the ability to properly wear and use PPE before they are allowed to perform work requiring the use of the PPE. If an employer believes that a previously trained employee is not demonstrating the proper understanding and skill level in the use of PPE, that employee should receive retraining. Other situations that require additional or retraining of employees include changes in the workplace or in the type of required PPE that make the prior training obsolete.Eye and Face ProtectionEmployees can be exposed to a large number of hazards that pose danger to their eyes and face. OSHA requires employers to ensure that employees have appropriate eye or face protection when exposed to eye or face hazards from flying particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, acids or caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors, potentially infected material or potentially harmful light radiation.Many occupational eye injuries occur because employees are not wearing any eye protection while others result from wearing improper, inadequate, or poorly fitting eye protection. Employers must be sure that their employees wear appropriate eye and face protection and that the selected form of protection is appropriate to the work being performed and properly fits each employee exposed to the hazard.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION10Prescription LensesUse of ordinary prescription corrective lenses will not provide adequate protection against most occupational eye and face hazards, so employers must make sure that employees with corrective lenses either wear eye protection that incorporates the prescription into the design of adequate eye protection or wear eye protection that fits over their prescription lenses. It is important to ensure that the protective eyewear fits properly, and does not disturb the proper positioning of the prescription lenses so that the employee’s vision will not be inhibited or limited. In addition, employees who wear contact lenses must wear eye or face PPE when working in hazardous conditions.Eye Protection for Exposed EmployeesOSHA requires that eye protection be routinely considered for use by carpenters, electricians, machinists, mechanics, millwrights, plumbers and pipefitters, sheet metal employees and tinsmiths, assemblers, sanders, grinding machine operators, welders, laborers, chemical process operators and handlers, sawyers, timber cutting and logging workers. Employers of employees in other job categories should decide whether there is a need for eye and face PPE through a hazard assessment.Examples of potential eye or face hazards include: ■Dust, dirt, metal or wood chips contacting or entering the eye from activities such as chipping, grinding, sawing, hammering, using power tools, or from sources such as strong winds. ■Chemical splashes from corrosive substances, hot liquids, solvents or other hazardous solutions. ■Objects swinging into the eye or face, such as tree limbs, chains, tools or ropes. ■Radiant energy from welding, harmful rays from the use of lasers or other radiant light (as well as heat, glare, sparks, splash and flying particles).\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT11Types of Eye ProtectionSelecting suitable eye and face protection for employees should take into consideration the following elements: ■Ability to protect against specific workplace hazards. ■Should fit properly and be reasonably comfortable to wear. ■Should provide unrestricted vision and movement. ■Should be durable and cleanable. ■Should allow unrestricted functioning of any other required PPE.The eye and face protection selected for employee use must clearly identify the manufacturer. Any new eye and face protective devices must comply with any of the following; ANSI Z87.1-2010, ANSI Z87.1-2003, or ANSI Z87.1-1989(R1998) or be at least as effective as this standard requires. Some of the most common types of eye and face protection include the following: ■Safety spectacles. These protective eyeglasses have safety frames constructed of metal or plastic and impact-resistant lenses. Side shields are available on some models. ■Goggles. This tight-fitting eye protection completely covers the eyes, eye sockets, and the facial area immediately surrounding the eyes and provide protection from impact, dust and splashes. Some goggles will fit over corrective lenses. ■Welding shields. Constructed of vulcanized fiber or fiberglass and fitted with a filtered lens, welding shields protect eyes from burns caused by infrared or intense radiant light; they also protect both the eyes and face from flying sparks, metal spatter and slag chips produced during welding, brazing, soldering and cutting operations. OSHA requires filter lenses to have a shade appropriate to protect against the specific hazards of the work being performed in order to protect against harmful light radiation.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION12 ■Laser safety goggles. These specialty goggles protect against intense concentrations of light produced by lasers. The type of laser safety goggles an employer chooses will depend upon the equipment and operating conditions in the workplace. ■Face shields. These transparent sheets of plastic extend from the eyebrows to below the chin and across the entire width of the employee’s head. Some are polarized for glare protection. Face shields protect against potential splashes or sprays of hazardous liquids, droplets, and particles but will not provide adequate protection against impact hazards. Face shields used in combination with goggles or safety spectacles will provide additional protection against splash and impact hazards.Each type of protective eyewear is designed to protect against specific hazards. Employers can identify the specific workplace hazards that threaten employees’ eyes and faces by completing a hazard assessment as outlined in the earlier section.Welding OperationsThe intense light associated with welding operations can cause serious, sometimes permanent, eye damage if operators do not wear proper eye protection. The intensity of light or radiant energy produced by welding, cutting or brazing operations varies according to a number of factors including the task producing the light, the electrode size and the arc current. Table 1 shows the minimum protective shades for filter lenses for a variety of welding, cutting and brazing operations in general industry and in the shipbuilding industry.\r\n",

Then go to a lighter shade which gives sufficient view of the weld zone without going below the minimum. In oxyfuel gas welding or cutting where the torch produces a high yellow light, it is desirable to use a filter lens that absorbs the yellow or sodium line in the visible light of the (spectrum) operation.** These values apply where the actual arc is clearly seen. Experience has shown that lighter filters may be used when the arc is hidden by the workpiece.The construction industry has separate requirements for filter lens protective numbers for specific types of welding operations, as indicated in Table 2, below:Table 2: Construction Industry Requirements for Filter Lens Shade Numbers for Protection Against Radiant EnergyWelding OperationShade NumberShielded metal-arc welding1/16-, 3/32-, 1/8-, 5/32-inch diameter electrodes10Gas-shielded arc welding (nonferrous)1/16-, 3/32-, 1/8-, 5/32-inch diameter electrodes11Gas-shielded arc welding (ferrous)1/16-, 3/32-, 1/8-, 5/32-inch diameter electrodes12Shielded metal-arc welding3/16-, 7/32-, 1/4-inch diameter electrodes125/16-, 3/8-inch diameter electrodes14Atomic hydrogen welding10 - 14Carbon-arc welding14Soldering2Torch brazing3 or 4Light cutting, up to 1 inch3 or 4Medium cutting, 1 to 6 inches4 or 5\r\n",

Laser retinal burns can be painless, so it is essential that all personnel in or around laser operations wear appropriate eye protection.Laser safety goggles should protect for the specific wavelength of the laser and must be of sufficient optical density for the energy involved. Safety goggles intended for use with laser beams must be labeled with the laser wavelengths for which they are intended to be used, the optical density of those wavelengths and the visible light transmission.The table below lists maximum power or energy densities and appropriate protection levels for optical densities 5 through 8.Table 3: Selecting Laser Safety GlassAttenuationIntensity, CW maximum power density (watts/cm2) Optical density (O.D.)Attenuation  factor10-2510510-161061.0710710.08108Source: 29 CFR 1926.102(c)(2)(i).\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION16Head ProtectionProtecting employees from potential head injuries is a key element of any safety program. A head injury can impair an employee for life or it can be fatal. Wearing a safety helmet or hard hat is one of the easiest ways to protect an employee’s head from injury. Hard hats can protect employees from impact and penetration hazards as well as from electrical shock and burn hazards.Employers must ensure that their employees wear head protection if any of the following apply: ■Objects might fall from above and strike them on the head; ■They might bump their heads against fixed objects, such as exposed pipes or beams; or ■There is a possibility of accidental head contact with electrical hazards.Some examples of occupations in which employees should be required to wear head protection include construction workers, carpenters, electricians, linemen, plumbers and pipefitters, timber and log cutters, and welders. Whenever there is a danger of objects falling from above, such as working below others who are using tools or working under a conveyor belt, head protection must be worn. In general, protective helmets or hard hats should do the following: ■Resist penetration by objects. ■Absorb the shock of a blow. ■Be water-resistant and slow burning. ■Have clear instructions explaining proper adjustment and replacement of the suspension and headband.Hard hats must have a hard outer shell and a shock-absorbing lining that incorporates a headband and straps that suspend the shell from 1 to 1 1/4 inches (2.54 cm to 3.18 cm) away from the head. This type of design provides shock absorption during an impact and ventilation during normal wear.\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT17Protective headgear must comply with any of the following consensus standards ANSI Z89.1-2009, ANSI Z89.1-2003, or ANSI Z89.1-1997 or provide an equivalent level of protection. Types of Hard HatsThere are many types of hard hats available in the marketplace today. In addition to selecting protective headgear that meets ANSI standard requirements, employers should ensure that employees wear hard hats that provide appropriate protection against potential workplace hazards. It is important for employers to understand all potential hazards when making this selection, including electrical hazards. This can be done through a comprehensive hazard analysis and an awareness of the different types of protective headgear available.Hard hats are divided into three industrial classes: ■Class A hard hats provide impact and penetration resistance along with limited voltage protection (up to 2,200 volts). ■Class B hard hats provide the highest level of protection against electrical hazards, with high-voltage shock and burn protection (up to 20,000 volts). They also provide protection from impact and penetration hazards by flying/falling objects. ■Class C hard hats provide lightweight comfort and impact protection but offer no protection from electrical hazards.Another class of protective headgear on the market is called a “bump hat,” designed for use in areas with low head clearance. They are recommended for areas where protection is needed from head bumps and lacerations. These are not designed to protect against falling or flying objects and are not ANSI approved. It is essential to check the type of hard hat employees are using to ensure that the equipment provides appropriate protection. Each hat should bear a label inside the shell that lists the manufacturer, the ANSI designation and the class of the hat.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION18Size and Care ConsiderationsHead protection that is either too large or too small is inappropriate for use, even if it meets all other requirements. Protective headgear must fit appropriately on the body and for the head size of each individual. Most protective headgear comes in a variety of sizes with adjustable headbands to ensure a proper fit (many adjust in 1/8-inch increments). A proper fit should allow sufficient clearance between the shell and the suspension system for ventilation and distribution of an impact. The hat should not bind, slip, fall off or irritate the skin.Some protective headgear allows for the use of various accessories to help employees deal with changing environmental conditions, such as slots for earmuffs, safety glasses, face shields and mounted lights. Optional brims may provide additional protection from the sun and some hats have channels that guide rainwater away from the face. Protective headgear accessories must not compromise the safety elements of the equipment.Periodic cleaning and inspection will extend the useful life of protective headgear. A daily inspection of the hard hat shell, suspension system and other accessories for holes, cracks, tears or other damage that might compromise the protective value of the hat is essential. Paints, paint thinners and some cleaning agents can weaken the shells of hard hats and may eliminate electrical resistance. Consult the helmet manufacturer for information on the effects of paint and cleaning materials on their hard hats. Never drill holes, paint or apply labels to protective headgear as this may reduce the integrity of the protection. Do not store protective headgear in direct sunlight, such as on the rear window shelf of a car, since sunlight and extreme heat can damage them.Hard hats with any of the following defects should be removed from service and replaced: ■Perforation, cracking, or deformity of the brim or shell; ■Indication of exposure of the brim or shell to heat, chemicals or ultraviolet light and other radiation (in addition to a loss of surface gloss, such signs include chalking or flaking).\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT19Always replace a hard hat if it sustains an impact, even if damage is not noticeable. Suspension systems are offered as replacement parts and should be replaced when damaged or when excessive wear is noticed. It is not necessary to replace the entire hard hat when deterioration or tears of the suspension systems are noticed.Foot and Leg ProtectionEmployees who face possible foot or leg injuries from falling or rolling objects or from crushing or penetrating materials should wear protective footwear. Also, employees whose work involves exposure to hot substances or corrosive or poisonous materials must have protective gear to cover exposed body parts, including legs and feet. If an employee’s feet may be exposed to electrical hazards, non-conductive footwear should be worn. On the other hand, workplace exposure to static electricity may necessitate the use of conductive footwear.Examples of situations in which an employee should wear foot and/or leg protection include: ■When heavy objects such as barrels or tools might roll onto or fall on the employee’s feet; ■Working with sharp objects such as nails or spikes that could pierce the soles or uppers of ordinary shoes; ■Exposure to molten metal that might splash on feet or legs; ■Working on or around hot, wet or slippery surfaces; and ■Working when electrical hazards are present.Protective footwear must comply with any of the following consensus standards; ASTM F-2412-2005, “Standard Test Methods for Foot Protection,” and ASTM F-2413-2005, “Standard Specification for Performance Requirements for Protective Footwear”, ANSI Z41-1999, “American National Standard for Personal Protection - Protective Footwear”, or ANSI Z41-1991, “American National Standard for Personal Protection - Protective Footwear”, or provide equivalent protection. All ANSI-approved footwear has a protective toe \r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION20and offers impact and compression protection, but the type and amount of protection is not always the same. Different footwear protects in different ways. Check the product’s labeling or consult the manufacturer to make sure the footwear will protect the user from the hazards they face.Foot and leg protection choices include the following: ■Leggings protect the lower legs and feet from heat hazards such as molten metal or welding sparks. Safety snaps allow leggings to be removed quickly. ■Metatarsal guards protect the instep area from impact and compression. Made of aluminum, steel, fiber or plastic, these guards may be strapped to the outside of shoes. ■Toe guards fit over the toes of regular shoes to protect the toes from impact and compression hazards. They may be made of steel, aluminum or plastic. ■Combination foot and shin guards protect the lower legs and feet, and may be used in combination with toe guards when greater protection is needed. ■Safety shoes have impact-resistant toes and heat-resistant soles that protect the feet against hot work surfaces common in roofing, paving and hot metal industries. The metal insoles of some safety shoes protect against puncture wounds. Safety shoes may also be designed to be electrically conductive to prevent the buildup of static electricity in areas with the potential for explosive atmospheres or nonconductive to protect employees from workplace electrical hazards.Special Purpose ShoesElectrically conductive shoes provide protection against the buildup of static electricity. Employees working in explosive and hazardous locations such as explosives manufacturing facilities or grain elevators must wear conductive shoes to reduce the risk of static electricity buildup on the body that could produce a spark and cause an explosion or fire. Foot powder should not be used in conjunction with protective conductive footwear \r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT21because it provides insulation, reducing the conductive ability of the shoes. Silk, wool and nylon socks can produce static electricity and should not be worn with conductive footwear. Conductive shoes must be removed when the task requiring their use is completed. Note: Employees exposed to electrical hazards must never wear conductive shoes.Electrical hazard, safety-toe shoes are nonconductive and will prevent the wearers’ feet from completing an electrical circuit to the ground. These shoes can protect against open circuits of up to 600 volts in dry conditions and should be used in conjunction with other insulating equipment and additional precautions to reduce the risk of an employee becoming a path for hazardous electrical energy. The insulating protection of electrical hazard, safety-toe shoes may be compromised if the shoes become wet, the soles are worn through, metal particles become embedded in the sole or heel, or employees touch conductive, grounded items. Note: Nonconductive footwear must not be used in explosive or hazardous locations.Foundry ShoesIn addition to insulating the feet from the extreme heat of molten metal, foundry shoes keep hot metal from lodging in shoe eyelets, tongues or other shoe parts. These snug-fitting leather or leather-substitute shoes have leather or rubber soles and rubber heels. All foundry shoes must have built-in safety toes.Care of Protective FootwearAs with all protective equipment, safety footwear should be inspected prior to each use. Shoes and leggings should be checked for wear and tear at reasonable intervals. This includes looking for cracks or holes, separation of materials, broken buckles or laces.The soles of shoes should be checked for pieces of metal or other embedded items that could present electrical or tripping hazards. Employees should follow the manufacturers’ recommendations for cleaning and maintenance of protective footwear.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION22Hand and Arm ProtectionIf a workplace hazard assessment reveals that employees face potential injury to hands and arms that cannot be eliminated through engineering and work practice controls, employers must ensure that employees wear appropriate protection. Potential hazards include skin absorption of harmful substances, chemical or thermal burns, electrical dangers, bruises, abrasions, cuts, punctures, fractures and amputations. Protective equipment includes gloves, finger guards and arm coverings or elbow-length gloves.Employers should explore all possible engineering and work practice controls to eliminate hazards and use PPE to provide additional protection against hazards that cannot be completely eliminated through other means. For example, machine guards may eliminate a hazard. Installing a barrier to prevent employees from placing their hands at the point of contact between a table saw blade and the item being cut is another method.Types of Protective GlovesThere are many types of gloves available today to protect against a wide variety of hazards. The nature of the hazard and the operation involved will affect the selection of gloves. The variety of potential occupational hand injuries makes selecting the right pair of gloves challenging. It is essential that employees use gloves specifically designed for the hazards and tasks found in their workplace because gloves designed for one function may not protect against a different function even though they may appear to be an appropriate protective device.The following are examples of some factors that may influence the selection of protective gloves for a workplace. ■Type of chemicals handled. ■Nature of contact (total immersion, splash, etc.). ■Duration of contact.\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT23 ■Area requiring protection (hand only, forearm, arm). ■Grip requirements (dry, wet, oily). ■Thermal protection. ■Size and comfort. ■Abrasion/resistance requirements.Gloves made from a wide variety of materials are designed for many types of workplace hazards. In general, gloves fall into four groups: ■Gloves made of leather, canvas or metal mesh; ■Fabric and coated fabric gloves; ■Chemical- and liquid-resistant gloves; ■Insulating rubber gloves (See 29 CFR 1910.137 and the following section on electrical protective equipment for detailed require- ments on the selection, use and care of insulating rubber gloves).Leather, Canvas or Metal Mesh GlovesSturdy gloves made from metal mesh, leather or canvas provide protection against cuts and burns. Leather or canvas gloves also protect against sustained heat. ■Leather gloves protect against sparks, moderate heat, blows, chips and rough objects. ■Aluminized gloves provide reflective and insulating protection against heat and require an insert made of synthetic materials to protect against heat and cold. ■Aramid fiber gloves protect against heat and cold, are cut- and abrasive-resistant and wear well. ■Synthetic gloves of various materials offer protection against heat and cold, are cut- and abrasive-resistant and may withstand some diluted acids. These materials do not stand up against alkalis and solvents.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION24Fabric and Coated Fabric GlovesFabric and coated fabric gloves are made of cotton or other fabric to provide varying degrees of protection. ■Fabric gloves protect against dirt, slivers, chafing and abrasions. They do not provide sufficient protection for use with rough, sharp or heavy materials. Adding a plastic coating will strengthen some fabric gloves. ■Coated fabric gloves are normally made from cotton flannel with napping on one side. By coating the unnapped side with plastic, fabric gloves are transformed into general-purpose hand protection offering slip-resistant qualities. These gloves are used for tasks ranging from handling bricks and wire to chemical laboratory containers. When selecting gloves to protect against chemical exposure hazards, always check with the manufacturer or review the manufacturer’s product literature to determine the gloves’ effectiveness against specific workplace chemicals and conditions.Chemical- and Liquid-Resistant GlovesChemical-resistant gloves are made with different kinds of rubber: natural, butyl, neoprene, nitrile and fluorocarbon (viton); or various kinds of plastic: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene. These materials can be blended or laminated for better performance. As a general rule, the thicker the glove material, the greater the chemical resistance, but thick gloves may impair grip and dexterity, having a negative impact on safety.Some examples of chemical-resistant gloves include: ■Butyl gloves are made of a synthetic rubber and protect against a wide variety of chemicals, such as peroxide, rocket fuels, highly corrosive acids (nitric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrofluoric acid and red-fuming nitric acid), strong bases, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters and nitro compounds. Butyl gloves also resist oxidation, ozone corrosion and \r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT25abrasion, and remain flexible at low temperatures. Butyl rubber does not perform well with aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and halogenated solvents. ■Natural (latex) rubber gloves are comfortable to wear, which makes them a popular general-purpose glove. They feature outstanding tensile strength, elasticity, and temperature resistance. In addition to resisting abrasions caused by grinding and polishing, these gloves protect employees’ hands from most water solutions of acids, alkalis, salts, and ketones. Latex gloves have caused allergic reactions in some individuals and may not be appropriate for all employees. Hypoallergenic gloves, glove liners and powderless gloves are possible alternatives for employees who are allergic to latex gloves. ■Neoprene gloves are made of synthetic rubber and offer a range of protect against hydraulic fluids, gasoline, alcohols, organic acids and alkalis. They generally have chemical and wear resistance properties superior to those made of natural rubber. ■Nitrile gloves are made of a copolymer and provide protection from chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene. Although intended for jobs requiring dexterity and sensitivity, nitrile gloves stand up to heavy use even after prolonged exposure to substances that cause other gloves to deteriorate. They offer protection when working with oils, greases, acids, caustics and alcohols but are generally not recommended for use with strong oxidizing agents, aromatic solvents, ketones and acetates.Table 4 from the U.S. Department of Energy (Occupational Safety and Health Technical Reference Manual) rates various gloves protective qualities against specific chemicals. This table will help you select the most appropriate gloves to protect your employees. The rating abbreviations are as follows: VG: Very Good; G: Good; F: Fair; P: Poor (not recommended).

A visual inspection will help detect cuts or tears but a more thorough inspection - by filling the gloves with water and tightly rolling the cuff towards the fingers - will help reveal any pinhole leaks. Gloves that are discolored or stiff may indicate deficiencies caused by excessive use or degradation from chemical exposure.Discard and replace any gloves with impaired protective ability. Carefully evaluate any reuse of chemical-resistant gloves, taking into consideration the absorptive qualities of the gloves. A decision to reuse chemically-exposed gloves should take into consideration the manufacturer’s recommendation for proper use and storage.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION30Body ProtectionEmployees who face possible bodily injury of any kind that cannot be eliminated through engineering, work practice or administrative controls must wear appropriate body protection while performing their jobs. In addition to cuts and radiation, the following are examples of workplace hazards that could cause bodily injury: ■Temperature extremes; ■Hot splashes from molten metals and other hot liquids; ■Potential impacts from tools, machinery and materials; ■Hazardous chemicals.There are varieties of protective clothing available for specific hazards. Employers are required to ensure that their employees wear personal protective equipment parts of the body exposed to possible injury. Examples of body protection include laboratory coats, coveralls, vests, jackets, aprons, surgical gowns and full body suits.If a hazard assessment indicates a need for full body protection against toxic substances or harmful physical agents, carefully inspect the PPE before each use, ensure proper fit and that it properly functions for the purpose for which it is intended.Protective clothing comes in a variety of materials, each effective against particular hazards, such as: ■Paper-like fiber is used for disposable suits to provide protection against dust and splashes. ■Treated wool and cotton adapts well to changing temperatures, is comfortable and fire-resistant and protects against dust, abrasions and rough and irritating surfaces. ■Duck is a closely woven cotton fabric that protects against cuts and bruises when handling heavy, sharp or rough materials. ■Leather is often used to protect against dry heat and flames.\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT31 ■Rubber, rubberized fabrics, neoprene and plastics protect against certain chemicals and physical hazards. When chemical or physical hazards are present, check with the clothing manufacturer to ensure that the material selected will provide adequate protection against the specific hazard.Hearing ProtectionCertain operations generate noise requiring hearing protection. Employee exposure to excessive noise depends upon a number of factors, including: ■The noise level, as measured in decibels (dB). ■The duration of each employee’s exposure to the noise. ■Whether employees move between work areas with different noise levels. ■Whether noise is generated from one or multiple sources.Generally, the louder the noise, the shorter the exposure time before hearing protection is required. For instance, employees may be exposed to a noise level of 90 dB for 8 hours per day (unless they experience a Standard Threshold Shift) before hearing protection is required. On the other hand, if the noise level reaches 115 dB hearing protection is required if the anticipated exposure exceeds 15 minutes.For a more detailed discussion of the requirements for a comprehensive hearing conservation program, see OSHA Publication 3074 (2002), “Hearing Conservation” or refer to the OSHA standard at 29 CFR 1910.95(c), Hearing Conservation Program.Table 5, below, shows permissible noise exposures at specific decibel levels for specific time periods. Noise exposure is considered continuous if the interval between occurrences of the maximum noise level is one second or less. Noises not meeting this definition are considered impact or impulse noises (loud momentary explosions of sound) and exposures to this \r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION32type of noise must not exceed 140 dB. Examples of situations or tools that may result in impact or impulse noises are powder-actuated nail guns, the use of a punch press or drop hammers.Table 5: Permissible Noise ExposuresDuration per day,  in hoursSound level  in dB*890692495397210011/210211051/21101/4 or less115*When measured on the A scale of a standard sound level meter at slow response.Source: 29 CFR 1910.95, Table G-16.If engineering and work practice controls do not lower employee exposure to workplace noise to acceptable levels, employees must wear appropriate hearing protection. It is important to understand that hearing protectors reduce only the amount of noise that gets through to the ears. The amount of this reduction is referred to as attenuation, which differs according to the type of hearing protection used and how well it fits. Hearing protectors worn by employees must reduce an employee’s noise exposure to within the acceptable limits noted in Table 5. Refer to 29 CFR 1910.95, Occupational Noise Exposure, Appendix B, Methods for estimating the adequacy of hearing protector attenuation, for detailed information on methods to estimate the attenuation effectiveness of hearing protectors based on the device’s noise reduction rating (NRR).Manufacturers of hearing protection devices must display the device’s NRR on the product packaging. If employees are exposed to occupational noise at or above 85 dB averaged \r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT33over an eight-hour period, the employer is required to institute a hearing conservation program that includes regular testing of employees’ hearing by qualified professionals. Refer to 29 CFR 1910.95(c) for a description of the requirements for a hearing conservation program.Some types of hearing protection include: ■Single-use earplugs are made of waxed cotton, foam, silicone rubber or fiberglass wool. They are self-forming and, when properly inserted, they work as well as most molded earplugs. ■Pre-formed or molded earplugs are individually fitted by a professional and can be disposable or reusable. Reusable plugs should be cleaned after each use. ■Earmuffs require a perfect seal around the ear. Glasses, facial hair, long hair or facial movements such as chewing may reduce the protective value of earmuffs.Personal Fall Protection SystemsIf a workplace hazard assessment reveals that employees face potential injury from fall hazards, and engineering controls cannot be used to eliminate the hazard, personal fall protection systems are another option for employers. “Personal fall protection system” (PFPS) means a system (including all components) an employer uses to provide protection from falling or to safely arrest an employee’s fall if one occurs. Examples of personal fall protection systems include personal fall arrest systems, positioning systems, and travel restraint systems.29 CFR 1910.140 sets forth requirements for personal fall protection systems. There are several types of these systems: ■Travel restraint systems consist of a combination of an anchorage, anchorage connector, lanyard (or other means of connection), and body support that an employer uses to eliminate the possibility of an employee going over the edge of a walking-working surface.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION34 ■A positioning system is a system of equipment and connectors that, when used with a body harness or body belt, allows an employee to be supported on an elevated vertical surface, such as a wall or windowsill, and work with both hands free. Positioning systems also are called “positioning system devices” and “work-positioning equipment.” ■A personal fall arrest system is a system used to arrest an employee in a fall from a walking-working surface. It consists of a body harness, anchorage, and connector. The means of connection may include a lanyard, deceleration device, lifeline, or a suitable combination of these.Generally, components of PFPS must be compatible and meet certain strength requirements. Anchorages that PFPS attach to must be capable of supporting at least 5,000 pounds for each employee attached. If a fall occurs, components subjected to impact loading must be removed from service immediately and not used again until a competent person inspects the system or components and determines that it is not damaged and safe for use for employee personal fall protection. Body belts are prohibited as part of personal fall arrest systems. For more information and to see all the requirements for PFPS, please see 29 CFR 1910.140.OSHA Assistance, Services, and ProgramsOSHA has a great deal of information to assist employers in complying with their responsibilities under OSHA law. Several OSHA programs and services can help employers identify and correct job hazards, as well as improve their safety and health program.Establishing a Safety and Health ProgramSafety and health programs are systems that can substantially reduce the number and severity of workplace injuries and illnesses, while reducing costs to employers.

       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT3IntroductionHazards exist in every workplace in many different forms: sharp edges, falling objects, flying sparks, chemicals, noise and a myriad of other potentially dangerous situations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that employers protect their employees from workplace hazards that can cause injury.Controlling a hazard at its source is the best way to protect employees. Depending on the hazard or workplace conditions, OSHA recommends the use of engineering or work practice controls to manage or eliminate hazards to the greatest extent possible. For example, building a barrier between the hazard and employees is an engineering control; changing the way in which employees perform their work, (e.g., through job rotations) is an administrative control.When engineering, work practice, and administrative controls are not feasible or do not provide sufficient protection, employers must provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to their employees and ensure its use. Personal protective equipment, commonly referred to as “PPE”, is equipment worn to minimize exposure to a variety of hazards. Examples of PPE include such items as gloves, foot and eye protection, protective hearing devices (earplugs, muffs) hard hats, respirators and full body suits.This guide will help both employers and employees do the following: ■Understand the types of PPE. ■Know the basics of conducting a “hazard assessment” of the workplace. ■Select appropriate PPE for a variety of circumstances. ■Understand what kind of training is needed in the proper use and care of PPE.The information in this guide is general in nature and does not address all workplace hazards or PPE requirements. The information, methods and procedures in this guide are based \r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION4on the OSHA requirements for PPE as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 29 CFR 1910.132 (General requirements); 29 CFR 1910.133 (Eye and face protection); 29 CFR 1910.135 (Head protection); 29 CFR 1910.136 (Foot protection); 29 CFR 1910.137 (Electrical protective equipment); 29 CFR 1910.138 (Hand protection); 29 CFR 1910.140 (Personal Fall Protection) and regulations that cover the construction industry, at 29 CFR 1926.95 (Criteria for personal protective equipment); 29 CFR 1926.96 (Occupational foot protection); 29 CFR 1926.97 (Electrical protective equipment); 29 CFR 1926.100 (Head protection); 29 CFR 1926.101 (Hearing protection); and 29 CFR 1926.102 (Eye and face protection); and for the maritime industry at 29 CFR 1915.152 (General requirements); 29 CFR 1915.153 (Eye and face protection); 29 CFR 1915.155 (Head protection); 29 CFR 1915.156 (Foot protection); and 29 CFR 1915.157 (Hand and body protection). Please note this guide does not address PPE requirements related to respirators or respiratory protection (29 CFR 1910.134).The Requirement for PPETo ensure the greatest possible protection for employees in the workplace, the cooperative efforts of both employers and employees will help in establishing and maintaining a safe and healthful work environment.In general, employers are responsible for: ■Performing a “hazard assessment” of the workplace to identify and control physical and health hazards. ■Identifying and providing appropriate and adequate PPE for employees. ■Training employees in the use and care of the PPE. ■Maintaining PPE, including replacing worn or damaged PPE. ■Periodically reviewing, updating and evaluating the effectiveness of the PPE program.\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT5In general, employees should: ■Properly wear PPE, ■Attend training sessions on PPE, ■Care for, clean and maintain PPE, and ■Inform a supervisor of the need to repair or replace PPE. Specific requirements for PPE are presented in many differentOSHA standards, published in 29 CFR. Some standards require that employers provide PPE at no cost to the employee while others simply state that the employer must provide PPE. Appendix A at page 40 lists those standards that require the employer to provide PPE and those that require the employer to provide PPE at no cost to the employee.A final rule on payment for PPE, published in November 2007, requires that all PPE, with a few exceptions, will be provided by the employer at no cost to the employee. The 2007 final rule also clarified OSHA’s requirements regarding payment for employee-provided PPE and for replacement PPE. The final rule is found at 72 Fed. Reg. 64341-64430 (Nov. 15, 2007).The Hazard AssessmentA first critical step in protecting employees is to use a “hazard assessment to identify physical and health hazards in the workplace. Potential hazards may be physical or health-related and a comprehensive hazard assessment should identify hazards in both categories. Examples of physical hazards include moving objects, fluctuating temperatures, high intensity lighting, rolling or pinching objects, electrical connections, and sharp edges. Examples of health hazards include overexposure to harmful dusts, chemicals or radiation.The hazard assessment should begin with a walkthrough survey of the facility to develop a list of potential hazards in the following basic hazard categories:\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION6 ■Fall hazards, ■Impact, ■Penetration, ■Compression (roll-over), ■Chemical, ■Heat/cold, ■Harmful dust, ■Light (optical) radiation, and ■Biologic.In addition to noting the basic layout of the facility and reviewing any history of occupational illnesses or injuries, things to look for during the walkthrough survey include: ■Sources of electricity. ■Sources of motion such as machines or processes where movement may exist that could result in an impact between personnel and equipment. ■Sources of high temperatures that could result in burns, eye injuries or fire. ■Types of chemicals used in the workplace. ■Sources of harmful dusts. ■Sources of light radiation, such as welding, brazing, cutting, furnaces, heat treating, high intensity lights, etc. ■The potential for falling or dropping objects. ■Sharp objects that could poke, cut, stab or puncture. ■Biologic hazards such as blood or other potentially infectious material. ■Unprotected edges where fall hazards may exist.When the walkthrough is complete, the employer should organize and analyze the data so that it may be efficiently used in determining the proper types of PPE required at the worksite.\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT7The employer should become aware of the different types of PPE available and the levels of protection offered. It is definitely a good idea to select PPE that will provide a level of protection greater than the minimum required to protect employees from hazards.Then periodically reassess the workplace for any changes in conditions, equipment or operating procedures that could create occupational hazards. This periodic reassessment should also include a review of injury and illness records to spot any trends or areas of concern and taking appropriate corrective action. The suitability of existing PPE, including an evaluation of its condition and age, should be included in the reassessment.Documentation of the hazard assessment is required through a written certification that includes the following information: ■Identification of the workplace evaluated; ■Name of the person conducting the assessment; ■Date of the assessment; and ■Identification of the document certifying completion of the hazard assessment.Selecting PPEAll PPE clothing and equipment must be of safe design and construction, and be maintained in a clean and reliable fashion. Employers shall take the fit and comfort of PPE into consideration when selecting appropriate items for their workplace.PPE that fits well and is comfortable to wear will encourage employee use. Most protective devices are available in multiple sizes and care should be taken to select the proper size for each employee. If several different types of PPE are worn together, make sure they are compatible. If PPE does not fit properly, it can make the difference between being safely covered or dangerously exposed. It may not provide the level of protection desired and may discourage employee use.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION8OSHA requires that many categories of PPE meet or be equivalent to standards approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). ANSI has been preparing safety standards since the 1920s, when the first safety standard was approved to protect the heads and eyes of industrial workers. Employers who need to provide PPE in the categories listed below must make certain that any new equipment procured meets the cited ANSI standard. Existing PPE stocks must meet the ANSI standard in effect at the time of its manufacture or provide protection equivalent to PPE manufactured to the ANSI criteria. Employers should inform employees who provide their own PPE of the employer’s selection decisions and ensure that any employee-owned PPE used in the workplace conforms to the employer’s criteria, based on the hazard assessment, OSHA requirements and ANSI standards. OSHA requires PPE to meet the following ANSI standards: ■Eye and Face Protection: ANSI Z87.1-2010, ANSI Z87.1-2003, or ANSI Z87.1-1989(R1998). ■Head Protection: ANSI Z89.1-2009, ANSI Z89.1-2003, or ANSI Z89.1-1997. ■Foot Protection: ASTMF-2412-2005 and ASTMF-2413-2005, ANSI Z41-1999, or ANSI Z41-1991. ■Electrical Rubber Insulating Equipment: ASTM D120-09, ASTM D-178-01 (2010), ASTM D-1048-12, ASTM D-1049-98 (2010), ASTM D-1050-05 (2011), or ASTM D1051-08.For hand protection, there is no ANSI standard for gloves but OSHA recommends that selection be based upon the tasks to be performed and the performance and construction characteristics of the glove material. For protection against chemicals, glove selection must be based on the chemicals encountered, the chemical resistance and the physical properties of the glove material.\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT9Training Employees in the Proper Use of PPEEmployers are required to train each employee who must use PPE. Employees must be trained to know at least the following: ■When PPE is necessary. ■What PPE is necessary. ■How to properly put on, take off, adjust and wear the PPE. ■The limitations of the PPE. ■Proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal of PPE. Employers shall make sure that each employee demonstrates an understanding of the PPE training (i.e., in a language they understand) as well as the ability to properly wear and use PPE before they are allowed to perform work requiring the use of the PPE. If an employer believes that a previously trained employee is not demonstrating the proper understanding and skill level in the use of PPE, that employee should receive retraining. Other situations that require additional or retraining of employees include changes in the workplace or in the type of required PPE that make the prior training obsolete.Eye and Face ProtectionEmployees can be exposed to a large number of hazards that pose danger to their eyes and face. OSHA requires employers to ensure that employees have appropriate eye or face protection when exposed to eye or face hazards from flying particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, acids or caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors, potentially infected material or potentially harmful light radiation.Many occupational eye injuries occur because employees are not wearing any eye protection while others result from wearing improper, inadequate, or poorly fitting eye protection. Employers must be sure that their employees wear appropriate eye and face protection and that the selected form of protection is appropriate to the work being performed and properly fits each employee exposed to the hazard.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION10Prescription LensesUse of ordinary prescription corrective lenses will not provide adequate protection against most occupational eye and face hazards, so employers must make sure that employees with corrective lenses either wear eye protection that incorporates the prescription into the design of adequate eye protection or wear eye protection that fits over their prescription lenses. It is important to ensure that the protective eyewear fits properly, and does not disturb the proper positioning of the prescription lenses so that the employee’s vision will not be inhibited or limited. In addition, employees who wear contact lenses must wear eye or face PPE when working in hazardous conditions.Eye Protection for Exposed EmployeesOSHA requires that eye protection be routinely considered for use by carpenters, electricians, machinists, mechanics, millwrights, plumbers and pipefitters, sheet metal employees and tinsmiths, assemblers, sanders, grinding machine operators, welders, laborers, chemical process operators and handlers, sawyers, timber cutting and logging workers. Employers of employees in other job categories should decide whether there is a need for eye and face PPE through a hazard assessment.Examples of potential eye or face hazards include: ■Dust, dirt, metal or wood chips contacting or entering the eye from activities such as chipping, grinding, sawing, hammering, using power tools, or from sources such as strong winds. ■Chemical splashes from corrosive substances, hot liquids, solvents or other hazardous solutions. ■Objects swinging into the eye or face, such as tree limbs, chains, tools or ropes. ■Radiant energy from welding, harmful rays from the use of lasers or other radiant light (as well as heat, glare, sparks, splash and flying particles).\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT11Types of Eye ProtectionSelecting suitable eye and face protection for employees should take into consideration the following elements: ■Ability to protect against specific workplace hazards. ■Should fit properly and be reasonably comfortable to wear. ■Should provide unrestricted vision and movement. ■Should be durable and cleanable. ■Should allow unrestricted functioning of any other required PPE.The eye and face protection selected for employee use must clearly identify the manufacturer. Any new eye and face protective devices must comply with any of the following; ANSI Z87.1-2010, ANSI Z87.1-2003, or ANSI Z87.1-1989(R1998) or be at least as effective as this standard requires. Some of the most common types of eye and face protection include the following: ■Safety spectacles. These protective eyeglasses have safety frames constructed of metal or plastic and impact-resistant lenses. Side shields are available on some models. ■Goggles. This tight-fitting eye protection completely covers the eyes, eye sockets, and the facial area immediately surrounding the eyes and provide protection from impact, dust and splashes. Some goggles will fit over corrective lenses. ■Welding shields. Constructed of vulcanized fiber or fiberglass and fitted with a filtered lens, welding shields protect eyes from burns caused by infrared or intense radiant light; they also protect both the eyes and face from flying sparks, metal spatter and slag chips produced during welding, brazing, soldering and cutting operations. OSHA requires filter lenses to have a shade appropriate to protect against the specific hazards of the work being performed in order to protect against harmful light radiation.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION12 ■Laser safety goggles. These specialty goggles protect against intense concentrations of light produced by lasers. The type of laser safety goggles an employer chooses will depend upon the equipment and operating conditions in the workplace. ■Face shields. These transparent sheets of plastic extend from the eyebrows to below the chin and across the entire width of the employee’s head. Some are polarized for glare protection. Face shields protect against potential splashes or sprays of hazardous liquids, droplets, and particles but will not provide adequate protection against impact hazards. Face shields used in combination with goggles or safety spectacles will provide additional protection against splash and impact hazards.Each type of protective eyewear is designed to protect against specific hazards. Employers can identify the specific workplace hazards that threaten employees’ eyes and faces by completing a hazard assessment as outlined in the earlier section.Welding OperationsThe intense light associated with welding operations can cause serious, sometimes permanent, eye damage if operators do not wear proper eye protection. The intensity of light or radiant energy produced by welding, cutting or brazing operations varies according to a number of factors including the task producing the light, the electrode size and the arc current. Table 1 shows the minimum protective shades for filter lenses for a variety of welding, cutting and brazing operations in general industry and in the shipbuilding industry.\r\n",

Then go to a lighter shade which gives sufficient view of the weld zone without going below the minimum. In oxyfuel gas welding or cutting where the torch produces a high yellow light, it is desirable to use a filter lens that absorbs the yellow or sodium line in the visible light of the (spectrum) operation.** These values apply where the actual arc is clearly seen. Experience has shown that lighter filters may be used when the arc is hidden by the workpiece.The construction industry has separate requirements for filter lens protective numbers for specific types of welding operations, as indicated in Table 2, below:Table 2: Construction Industry Requirements for Filter Lens Shade Numbers for Protection Against Radiant EnergyWelding OperationShade NumberShielded metal-arc welding1/16-, 3/32-, 1/8-, 5/32-inch diameter electrodes10Gas-shielded arc welding (nonferrous)1/16-, 3/32-, 1/8-, 5/32-inch diameter electrodes11Gas-shielded arc welding (ferrous)1/16-, 3/32-, 1/8-, 5/32-inch diameter electrodes12Shielded metal-arc welding3/16-, 7/32-, 1/4-inch diameter electrodes125/16-, 3/8-inch diameter electrodes14Atomic hydrogen welding10 - 14Carbon-arc welding14Soldering2Torch brazing3 or 4Light cutting, up to 1 inch3 or 4Medium cutting, 1 to 6 inches4 or 5\r\n",

Laser retinal burns can be painless, so it is essential that all personnel in or around laser operations wear appropriate eye protection.Laser safety goggles should protect for the specific wavelength of the laser and must be of sufficient optical density for the energy involved. Safety goggles intended for use with laser beams must be labeled with the laser wavelengths for which they are intended to be used, the optical density of those wavelengths and the visible light transmission.The table below lists maximum power or energy densities and appropriate protection levels for optical densities 5 through 8.Table 3: Selecting Laser Safety GlassAttenuationIntensity, CW maximum power density (watts/cm2) Optical density (O.D.)Attenuation  factor10-2510510-161061.0710710.08108Source: 29 CFR 1926.102(c)(2)(i).\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION16Head ProtectionProtecting employees from potential head injuries is a key element of any safety program. A head injury can impair an employee for life or it can be fatal. Wearing a safety helmet or hard hat is one of the easiest ways to protect an employee’s head from injury. Hard hats can protect employees from impact and penetration hazards as well as from electrical shock and burn hazards.Employers must ensure that their employees wear head protection if any of the following apply: ■Objects might fall from above and strike them on the head; ■They might bump their heads against fixed objects, such as exposed pipes or beams; or ■There is a possibility of accidental head contact with electrical hazards.Some examples of occupations in which employees should be required to wear head protection include construction workers, carpenters, electricians, linemen, plumbers and pipefitters, timber and log cutters, and welders. Whenever there is a danger of objects falling from above, such as working below others who are using tools or working under a conveyor belt, head protection must be worn. In general, protective helmets or hard hats should do the following: ■Resist penetration by objects. ■Absorb the shock of a blow. ■Be water-resistant and slow burning. ■Have clear instructions explaining proper adjustment and replacement of the suspension and headband.Hard hats must have a hard outer shell and a shock-absorbing lining that incorporates a headband and straps that suspend the shell from 1 to 1 1/4 inches (2.54 cm to 3.18 cm) away from the head. This type of design provides shock absorption during an impact and ventilation during normal wear.\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT17Protective headgear must comply with any of the following consensus standards ANSI Z89.1-2009, ANSI Z89.1-2003, or ANSI Z89.1-1997 or provide an equivalent level of protection. Types of Hard HatsThere are many types of hard hats available in the marketplace today. In addition to selecting protective headgear that meets ANSI standard requirements, employers should ensure that employees wear hard hats that provide appropriate protection against potential workplace hazards. It is important for employers to understand all potential hazards when making this selection, including electrical hazards. This can be done through a comprehensive hazard analysis and an awareness of the different types of protective headgear available.Hard hats are divided into three industrial classes: ■Class A hard hats provide impact and penetration resistance along with limited voltage protection (up to 2,200 volts). ■Class B hard hats provide the highest level of protection against electrical hazards, with high-voltage shock and burn protection (up to 20,000 volts). They also provide protection from impact and penetration hazards by flying/falling objects. ■Class C hard hats provide lightweight comfort and impact protection but offer no protection from electrical hazards.Another class of protective headgear on the market is called a “bump hat,” designed for use in areas with low head clearance. They are recommended for areas where protection is needed from head bumps and lacerations. These are not designed to protect against falling or flying objects and are not ANSI approved. It is essential to check the type of hard hat employees are using to ensure that the equipment provides appropriate protection. Each hat should bear a label inside the shell that lists the manufacturer, the ANSI designation and the class of the hat.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION18Size and Care ConsiderationsHead protection that is either too large or too small is inappropriate for use, even if it meets all other requirements. Protective headgear must fit appropriately on the body and for the head size of each individual. Most protective headgear comes in a variety of sizes with adjustable headbands to ensure a proper fit (many adjust in 1/8-inch increments). A proper fit should allow sufficient clearance between the shell and the suspension system for ventilation and distribution of an impact. The hat should not bind, slip, fall off or irritate the skin.Some protective headgear allows for the use of various accessories to help employees deal with changing environmental conditions, such as slots for earmuffs, safety glasses, face shields and mounted lights. Optional brims may provide additional protection from the sun and some hats have channels that guide rainwater away from the face. Protective headgear accessories must not compromise the safety elements of the equipment.Periodic cleaning and inspection will extend the useful life of protective headgear. A daily inspection of the hard hat shell, suspension system and other accessories for holes, cracks, tears or other damage that might compromise the protective value of the hat is essential. Paints, paint thinners and some cleaning agents can weaken the shells of hard hats and may eliminate electrical resistance. Consult the helmet manufacturer for information on the effects of paint and cleaning materials on their hard hats. Never drill holes, paint or apply labels to protective headgear as this may reduce the integrity of the protection. Do not store protective headgear in direct sunlight, such as on the rear window shelf of a car, since sunlight and extreme heat can damage them.Hard hats with any of the following defects should be removed from service and replaced: ■Perforation, cracking, or deformity of the brim or shell; ■Indication of exposure of the brim or shell to heat, chemicals or ultraviolet light and other radiation (in addition to a loss of surface gloss, such signs include chalking or flaking).\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT19Always replace a hard hat if it sustains an impact, even if damage is not noticeable. Suspension systems are offered as replacement parts and should be replaced when damaged or when excessive wear is noticed. It is not necessary to replace the entire hard hat when deterioration or tears of the suspension systems are noticed.Foot and Leg ProtectionEmployees who face possible foot or leg injuries from falling or rolling objects or from crushing or penetrating materials should wear protective footwear. Also, employees whose work involves exposure to hot substances or corrosive or poisonous materials must have protective gear to cover exposed body parts, including legs and feet. If an employee’s feet may be exposed to electrical hazards, non-conductive footwear should be worn. On the other hand, workplace exposure to static electricity may necessitate the use of conductive footwear.Examples of situations in which an employee should wear foot and/or leg protection include: ■When heavy objects such as barrels or tools might roll onto or fall on the employee’s feet; ■Working with sharp objects such as nails or spikes that could pierce the soles or uppers of ordinary shoes; ■Exposure to molten metal that might splash on feet or legs; ■Working on or around hot, wet or slippery surfaces; and ■Working when electrical hazards are present.Protective footwear must comply with any of the following consensus standards; ASTM F-2412-2005, “Standard Test Methods for Foot Protection,” and ASTM F-2413-2005, “Standard Specification for Performance Requirements for Protective Footwear”, ANSI Z41-1999, “American National Standard for Personal Protection - Protective Footwear”, or ANSI Z41-1991, “American National Standard for Personal Protection - Protective Footwear”, or provide equivalent protection. All ANSI-approved footwear has a protective toe \r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION20and offers impact and compression protection, but the type and amount of protection is not always the same. Different footwear protects in different ways. Check the product’s labeling or consult the manufacturer to make sure the footwear will protect the user from the hazards they face.Foot and leg protection choices include the following: ■Leggings protect the lower legs and feet from heat hazards such as molten metal or welding sparks. Safety snaps allow leggings to be removed quickly. ■Metatarsal guards protect the instep area from impact and compression. Made of aluminum, steel, fiber or plastic, these guards may be strapped to the outside of shoes. ■Toe guards fit over the toes of regular shoes to protect the toes from impact and compression hazards. They may be made of steel, aluminum or plastic. ■Combination foot and shin guards protect the lower legs and feet, and may be used in combination with toe guards when greater protection is needed. ■Safety shoes have impact-resistant toes and heat-resistant soles that protect the feet against hot work surfaces common in roofing, paving and hot metal industries. The metal insoles of some safety shoes protect against puncture wounds. Safety shoes may also be designed to be electrically conductive to prevent the buildup of static electricity in areas with the potential for explosive atmospheres or nonconductive to protect employees from workplace electrical hazards.Special Purpose ShoesElectrically conductive shoes provide protection against the buildup of static electricity. Employees working in explosive and hazardous locations such as explosives manufacturing facilities or grain elevators must wear conductive shoes to reduce the risk of static electricity buildup on the body that could produce a spark and cause an explosion or fire. Foot powder should not be used in conjunction with protective conductive footwear \r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT21because it provides insulation, reducing the conductive ability of the shoes. Silk, wool and nylon socks can produce static electricity and should not be worn with conductive footwear. Conductive shoes must be removed when the task requiring their use is completed. Note: Employees exposed to electrical hazards must never wear conductive shoes.Electrical hazard, safety-toe shoes are nonconductive and will prevent the wearers’ feet from completing an electrical circuit to the ground. These shoes can protect against open circuits of up to 600 volts in dry conditions and should be used in conjunction with other insulating equipment and additional precautions to reduce the risk of an employee becoming a path for hazardous electrical energy. The insulating protection of electrical hazard, safety-toe shoes may be compromised if the shoes become wet, the soles are worn through, metal particles become embedded in the sole or heel, or employees touch conductive, grounded items. Note: Nonconductive footwear must not be used in explosive or hazardous locations.Foundry ShoesIn addition to insulating the feet from the extreme heat of molten metal, foundry shoes keep hot metal from lodging in shoe eyelets, tongues or other shoe parts. These snug-fitting leather or leather-substitute shoes have leather or rubber soles and rubber heels. All foundry shoes must have built-in safety toes.Care of Protective FootwearAs with all protective equipment, safety footwear should be inspected prior to each use. Shoes and leggings should be checked for wear and tear at reasonable intervals. This includes looking for cracks or holes, separation of materials, broken buckles or laces.The soles of shoes should be checked for pieces of metal or other embedded items that could present electrical or tripping hazards. Employees should follow the manufacturers’ recommendations for cleaning and maintenance of protective footwear.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION22Hand and Arm ProtectionIf a workplace hazard assessment reveals that employees face potential injury to hands and arms that cannot be eliminated through engineering and work practice controls, employers must ensure that employees wear appropriate protection. Potential hazards include skin absorption of harmful substances, chemical or thermal burns, electrical dangers, bruises, abrasions, cuts, punctures, fractures and amputations. Protective equipment includes gloves, finger guards and arm coverings or elbow-length gloves.Employers should explore all possible engineering and work practice controls to eliminate hazards and use PPE to provide additional protection against hazards that cannot be completely eliminated through other means. For example, machine guards may eliminate a hazard. Installing a barrier to prevent employees from placing their hands at the point of contact between a table saw blade and the item being cut is another method.Types of Protective GlovesThere are many types of gloves available today to protect against a wide variety of hazards. The nature of the hazard and the operation involved will affect the selection of gloves. The variety of potential occupational hand injuries makes selecting the right pair of gloves challenging. It is essential that employees use gloves specifically designed for the hazards and tasks found in their workplace because gloves designed for one function may not protect against a different function even though they may appear to be an appropriate protective device.The following are examples of some factors that may influence the selection of protective gloves for a workplace. ■Type of chemicals handled. ■Nature of contact (total immersion, splash, etc.). ■Duration of contact.\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT23 ■Area requiring protection (hand only, forearm, arm). ■Grip requirements (dry, wet, oily). ■Thermal protection. ■Size and comfort. ■Abrasion/resistance requirements.Gloves made from a wide variety of materials are designed for many types of workplace hazards. In general, gloves fall into four groups: ■Gloves made of leather, canvas or metal mesh; ■Fabric and coated fabric gloves; ■Chemical- and liquid-resistant gloves; ■Insulating rubber gloves (See 29 CFR 1910.137 and the following section on electrical protective equipment for detailed require- ments on the selection, use and care of insulating rubber gloves).Leather, Canvas or Metal Mesh GlovesSturdy gloves made from metal mesh, leather or canvas provide protection against cuts and burns. Leather or canvas gloves also protect against sustained heat. ■Leather gloves protect against sparks, moderate heat, blows, chips and rough objects. ■Aluminized gloves provide reflective and insulating protection against heat and require an insert made of synthetic materials to protect against heat and cold. ■Aramid fiber gloves protect against heat and cold, are cut- and abrasive-resistant and wear well. ■Synthetic gloves of various materials offer protection against heat and cold, are cut- and abrasive-resistant and may withstand some diluted acids. These materials do not stand up against alkalis and solvents.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION24Fabric and Coated Fabric GlovesFabric and coated fabric gloves are made of cotton or other fabric to provide varying degrees of protection. ■Fabric gloves protect against dirt, slivers, chafing and abrasions. They do not provide sufficient protection for use with rough, sharp or heavy materials. Adding a plastic coating will strengthen some fabric gloves. ■Coated fabric gloves are normally made from cotton flannel with napping on one side. By coating the unnapped side with plastic, fabric gloves are transformed into general-purpose hand protection offering slip-resistant qualities. These gloves are used for tasks ranging from handling bricks and wire to chemical laboratory containers. When selecting gloves to protect against chemical exposure hazards, always check with the manufacturer or review the manufacturer’s product literature to determine the gloves’ effectiveness against specific workplace chemicals and conditions.Chemical- and Liquid-Resistant GlovesChemical-resistant gloves are made with different kinds of rubber: natural, butyl, neoprene, nitrile and fluorocarbon (viton); or various kinds of plastic: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene. These materials can be blended or laminated for better performance. As a general rule, the thicker the glove material, the greater the chemical resistance, but thick gloves may impair grip and dexterity, having a negative impact on safety.Some examples of chemical-resistant gloves include: ■Butyl gloves are made of a synthetic rubber and protect against a wide variety of chemicals, such as peroxide, rocket fuels, highly corrosive acids (nitric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrofluoric acid and red-fuming nitric acid), strong bases, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters and nitro compounds. Butyl gloves also resist oxidation, ozone corrosion and \r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT25abrasion, and remain flexible at low temperatures. Butyl rubber does not perform well with aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and halogenated solvents. ■Natural (latex) rubber gloves are comfortable to wear, which makes them a popular general-purpose glove. They feature outstanding tensile strength, elasticity, and temperature resistance. In addition to resisting abrasions caused by grinding and polishing, these gloves protect employees’ hands from most water solutions of acids, alkalis, salts, and ketones. Latex gloves have caused allergic reactions in some individuals and may not be appropriate for all employees. Hypoallergenic gloves, glove liners and powderless gloves are possible alternatives for employees who are allergic to latex gloves. ■Neoprene gloves are made of synthetic rubber and offer a range of protect against hydraulic fluids, gasoline, alcohols, organic acids and alkalis. They generally have chemical and wear resistance properties superior to those made of natural rubber. ■Nitrile gloves are made of a copolymer and provide protection from chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene. Although intended for jobs requiring dexterity and sensitivity, nitrile gloves stand up to heavy use even after prolonged exposure to substances that cause other gloves to deteriorate. They offer protection when working with oils, greases, acids, caustics and alcohols but are generally not recommended for use with strong oxidizing agents, aromatic solvents, ketones and acetates.Table 4 from the U.S. Department of Energy (Occupational Safety and Health Technical Reference Manual) rates various gloves protective qualities against specific chemicals. This table will help you select the most appropriate gloves to protect your employees. The rating abbreviations are as follows: VG: Very Good; G: Good; F: Fair; P: Poor (not recommended).

A visual inspection will help detect cuts or tears but a more thorough inspection - by filling the gloves with water and tightly rolling the cuff towards the fingers - will help reveal any pinhole leaks. Gloves that are discolored or stiff may indicate deficiencies caused by excessive use or degradation from chemical exposure.Discard and replace any gloves with impaired protective ability. Carefully evaluate any reuse of chemical-resistant gloves, taking into consideration the absorptive qualities of the gloves. A decision to reuse chemically-exposed gloves should take into consideration the manufacturer’s recommendation for proper use and storage.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION30Body ProtectionEmployees who face possible bodily injury of any kind that cannot be eliminated through engineering, work practice or administrative controls must wear appropriate body protection while performing their jobs. In addition to cuts and radiation, the following are examples of workplace hazards that could cause bodily injury: ■Temperature extremes; ■Hot splashes from molten metals and other hot liquids; ■Potential impacts from tools, machinery and materials; ■Hazardous chemicals.There are varieties of protective clothing available for specific hazards. Employers are required to ensure that their employees wear personal protective equipment parts of the body exposed to possible injury. Examples of body protection include laboratory coats, coveralls, vests, jackets, aprons, surgical gowns and full body suits.If a hazard assessment indicates a need for full body protection against toxic substances or harmful physical agents, carefully inspect the PPE before each use, ensure proper fit and that it properly functions for the purpose for which it is intended.Protective clothing comes in a variety of materials, each effective against particular hazards, such as: ■Paper-like fiber is used for disposable suits to provide protection against dust and splashes. ■Treated wool and cotton adapts well to changing temperatures, is comfortable and fire-resistant and protects against dust, abrasions and rough and irritating surfaces. ■Duck is a closely woven cotton fabric that protects against cuts and bruises when handling heavy, sharp or rough materials. ■Leather is often used to protect against dry heat and flames.\r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT31 ■Rubber, rubberized fabrics, neoprene and plastics protect against certain chemicals and physical hazards. When chemical or physical hazards are present, check with the clothing manufacturer to ensure that the material selected will provide adequate protection against the specific hazard.Hearing ProtectionCertain operations generate noise requiring hearing protection. Employee exposure to excessive noise depends upon a number of factors, including: ■The noise level, as measured in decibels (dB). ■The duration of each employee’s exposure to the noise. ■Whether employees move between work areas with different noise levels. ■Whether noise is generated from one or multiple sources.Generally, the louder the noise, the shorter the exposure time before hearing protection is required. For instance, employees may be exposed to a noise level of 90 dB for 8 hours per day (unless they experience a Standard Threshold Shift) before hearing protection is required. On the other hand, if the noise level reaches 115 dB hearing protection is required if the anticipated exposure exceeds 15 minutes.For a more detailed discussion of the requirements for a comprehensive hearing conservation program, see OSHA Publication 3074 (2002), “Hearing Conservation” or refer to the OSHA standard at 29 CFR 1910.95(c), Hearing Conservation Program.Table 5, below, shows permissible noise exposures at specific decibel levels for specific time periods. Noise exposure is considered continuous if the interval between occurrences of the maximum noise level is one second or less. Noises not meeting this definition are considered impact or impulse noises (loud momentary explosions of sound) and exposures to this \r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION32type of noise must not exceed 140 dB. Examples of situations or tools that may result in impact or impulse noises are powder-actuated nail guns, the use of a punch press or drop hammers.Table 5: Permissible Noise ExposuresDuration per day,  in hoursSound level  in dB*890692495397210011/210211051/21101/4 or less115*When measured on the A scale of a standard sound level meter at slow response.Source: 29 CFR 1910.95, Table G-16.If engineering and work practice controls do not lower employee exposure to workplace noise to acceptable levels, employees must wear appropriate hearing protection. It is important to understand that hearing protectors reduce only the amount of noise that gets through to the ears. The amount of this reduction is referred to as attenuation, which differs according to the type of hearing protection used and how well it fits. Hearing protectors worn by employees must reduce an employee’s noise exposure to within the acceptable limits noted in Table 5. Refer to 29 CFR 1910.95, Occupational Noise Exposure, Appendix B, Methods for estimating the adequacy of hearing protector attenuation, for detailed information on methods to estimate the attenuation effectiveness of hearing protectors based on the device’s noise reduction rating (NRR).Manufacturers of hearing protection devices must display the device’s NRR on the product packaging. If employees are exposed to occupational noise at or above 85 dB averaged \r\n",
       "PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT33over an eight-hour period, the employer is required to institute a hearing conservation program that includes regular testing of employees’ hearing by qualified professionals. Refer to 29 CFR 1910.95(c) for a description of the requirements for a hearing conservation program.Some types of hearing protection include: ■Single-use earplugs are made of waxed cotton, foam, silicone rubber or fiberglass wool. They are self-forming and, when properly inserted, they work as well as most molded earplugs. ■Pre-formed or molded earplugs are individually fitted by a professional and can be disposable or reusable. Reusable plugs should be cleaned after each use. ■Earmuffs require a perfect seal around the ear. Glasses, facial hair, long hair or facial movements such as chewing may reduce the protective value of earmuffs.Personal Fall Protection SystemsIf a workplace hazard assessment reveals that employees face potential injury from fall hazards, and engineering controls cannot be used to eliminate the hazard, personal fall protection systems are another option for employers. “Personal fall protection system” (PFPS) means a system (including all components) an employer uses to provide protection from falling or to safely arrest an employee’s fall if one occurs. Examples of personal fall protection systems include personal fall arrest systems, positioning systems, and travel restraint systems.29 CFR 1910.140 sets forth requirements for personal fall protection systems. There are several types of these systems: ■Travel restraint systems consist of a combination of an anchorage, anchorage connector, lanyard (or other means of connection), and body support that an employer uses to eliminate the possibility of an employee going over the edge of a walking-working surface.\r\n",
       "OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION34 ■A positioning system is a system of equipment and connectors that, when used with a body harness or body belt, allows an employee to be supported on an elevated vertical surface, such as a wall or windowsill, and work with both hands free. Positioning systems also are called “positioning system devices” and “work-positioning equipment.” ■A personal fall arrest system is a system used to arrest an employee in a fall from a walking-working surface. It consists of a body harness, anchorage, and connector. The means of connection may include a lanyard, deceleration device, lifeline, or a suitable combination of these.Generally, components of PFPS must be compatible and meet certain strength requirements. Anchorages that PFPS attach to must be capable of supporting at least 5,000 pounds for each employee attached. If a fall occurs, components subjected to impact loading must be removed from service immediately and not used again until a competent person inspects the system or components and determines that it is not damaged and safe for use for employee personal fall protection. Body belts are prohibited as part of personal fall arrest systems. For more information and to see all the requirements for PFPS, please see 29 CFR 1910.140.OSHA Assistance, Services, and ProgramsOSHA has a great deal of information to assist employers in complying with their responsibilities under OSHA law. Several OSHA programs and services can help employers identify and correct job hazards, as well as improve their safety and health program.Establishing a Safety and Health ProgramSafety and health programs are systems that can substantially reduce the number and severity of workplace injuries and illnesses, while reducing costs to employers.
